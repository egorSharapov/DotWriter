DotWriter
=========
DotWriter is a simple C++ API for creating DOT files for use in programs such as GraphViz. Express a graph in terms of nodes, edges, and subgraphs, and then DotWriter can generate a DOT file for you.

Currently, DotWriter is NOT safe for multithreaded code. If there is demand, I could change it so it is...

DotWriter does not work yet. I am still hashing out the API and features. :)
